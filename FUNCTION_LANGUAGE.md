# Function Language

The function language is a compact scripting language that runs within python. The language revolves around four main phrase-structures that are used to express a strong fundamental logic. The four structures are as follows:

__1. Function calls__
		"f(x)"
		- passes x to f.

__2. If Statements__
		"a:b"
		- executes b given a.

__3. Else Statements__
		"a:b/c"
		- executes b given a, otherwise executes c.

__4. If-Else Statements__
		"a:b /: c:d"
		- executes b given a, otherwise executes d given c.
