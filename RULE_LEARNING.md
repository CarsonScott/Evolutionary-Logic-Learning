# Inference Rules and Sequences

Inference rules are at the core of what it means to understand a language, as they give rise to additional knowledge that is not contained by any one element of a language but rather is derived through the interaction between those elements when they are composed in a sequence.

Inference-rule learning (IRL) is a two-step function where a topology is constructed from a set of variables that are observed and recorded over a finite period of time, and then the measurements are analyzed to derive a set of inferential equations (statements expressed in metalogic, a construction language used by a system internally to optimize the process of comparison, assessment, and construction of complex data types. T

Metalogical statements, or those of any type of language described here, combine operations with sets of variable symbols that are arranged in a specific orders, generate functions that take the given expression and map its structure to a high level model. By preserving the grammar of low-level structures, the rules of inference are necessarily maintained and integrated into the rules of higher-level languages.  


__Inference-Rule Example:__

    "if a and b and c, then infer d."
    
    (INFER, (a, b, c), d)
    
IRL allows for complex functions to be analyzed and simulated by relatively simple processes, i.e. following a set of pre-determined rules. Due to their inherent temporal nature, inference rules create logical systems that automatically enable things like planning to take place, thus for the consideration of possible worlds outside of what one is immediately perceiving. 

Rules of inference effectively generate predictions as a result of their very existence, providing a temporal platform on which to build more complex, meaningful structures.

# Game Rules and Actions

The generality of inference rules allows them to be applied in essentially any temporal domain, which is especially useful for understanding action. The optimal strategy one can take at any given time is dependent on a reliable understanding of effects each  potential action can cause when taken in some initial state. Agents who tend to make more accurate judgements about the world and themselves will obviously survive better in a competitive social space because they effectively make use of knowledge more efficiently than those with a tendency to yield unreliable or ineffective methods of data processing.
