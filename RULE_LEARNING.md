# Inference Rule Learning

Inference rules are at the core of what it means to understand a language, as they give rise to additional knowledge that is not contained by any one element of a language but rather is derived through the interaction between those elements when they are composed in a sequence.

Inference-rule learning (IRL) is a two-step process, in which a topology is built on a set of variables, and then explicitly converted into sets of inferential equations that can be expressed through statements.

    Example: (a,b,c) => (d)
   
    "if a and b and c, then assume d."
    
IRL allows for complex functions to be analyzed simulated in terms of relatively simple processes, i.e. following a set of rules. Due to their inherently temporal nature, inference rules create logical systems that automatically enable things like planning to take place, and thus allow for the consideration of possible worlds outside of that which is immediately perceived by an observer. Rules of inference effectively generate predictions through the very act perceiving them, and thus provide a temporal basis on which to build more complex meaningful structure.
