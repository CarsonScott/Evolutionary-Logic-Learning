# Inference Rules and Sequences

Inference rules are at the core of what it means to understand a language, as they give rise to additional knowledge that is not contained by any one element of a language but rather is derived through the interaction between those elements when they are composed in a sequence.

Inference-rule learning (IRL) is a two-step function where a topology is constructed from a set of variables that are observed and recorded over a finite period of time, and then the measurements are analyzed to derive a set of inferential equations, or statements expressed in a metalogic, a construction language used internally by the system to optimize the handling of complex data types.
Statements in any language combine operation and variable symbols in specific sequences to generate functions, which take the given statement and map its structure into higher levels. Preserving the grammar of lower-level structures in this way causees the inference rules to transfer upward and shape the grammar at higher levels, due to the fact that each structure necessarily satisfies the grammar at its own level before mapping to higher levels and constructing the rules of that level. 


__Inference-Rule Example:__

    "if a and b and c, then infer d."
    
    (INFER, (a, b, c), d)
    
IRL allows for complex functions to be analyzed and simulated by relatively simple processes, i.e. following a set of pre-determined rules. Due to their inherent temporal nature, inference rules create logical systems that automatically enable things like planning to take place, thus for the consideration of possible worlds outside of what one is immediately perceiving. 

Rules of inference effectively generate predictions as a result of their very existence, providing a temporal platform on which to build more complex, meaningful structures.

# Game Rules and Actions

The generality of inference rules allows them to be applied in essentially any temporal domain, which is especially useful for understanding action. The optimal strategy one can take at any given time is dependent on a reliable understanding of effects each  potential action can cause when taken in some initial state. Agents who tend to make more accurate judgements about the world and themselves will obviously survive better in a competitive social space because they effectively make use of knowledge more efficiently than those with a tendency to yield unreliable or ineffective methods of data processing.
